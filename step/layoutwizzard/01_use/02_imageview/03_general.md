| Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/intranda_step_crop_49.png) | This button saves all the configurations and image data made in the interface for the current process and closes the plug-in and the current Goobi workflow step.

| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/intranda_step_crop_50.png) | This button saves all configurations and image data made in the interface for the current process and closes the plugin. The user is then taken to the view `My Tasks`. The Goobi workflow is rotated back one step, i.e. generally to the previous step for the LayoutWizzard analysis. If this is an automatic step, it is executed immediately. |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/intranda_step_crop_52.png) | This button terminates the plugin immediately without saving any data before, except for image derivatives that have been saved via the save view or by resetting the entire analysis. The user is then returned to the view from which he entered the plugin. |
