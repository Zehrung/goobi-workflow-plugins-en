## Installation

To use the plugin, these two files must be copied to the following locations:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/step/plugin_intranda_step_placeholder.jar
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/GUI/plugin_intranda_step_placeholder-GUI.jar
```

This plugin has no configuration file and is therefore not configurable.

## Usage of the plugin

This plugin is integrated into the workflow so that it is available for a selected task. After accepting the task, the user can specify the number of images to be generated by the plugin and confirms this. Immediately afterwards, the plugin generates the defined number of images and stores them within the master folder of the process.

From this moment on, the generated placeholder images exist for the process and can be displayed and replaced in the course of the further workflow.
