## Usage of this plugin

To use the plugin, it must be integrated into a workflow and is then available for users to edit.

If a user accepts a task with this plugin, he can enter its user interface. There it is then possible to browse between the image files. A rich text editor is displayed for the respective current page, which shows any existing transcription or, if available, the OCR results. In this editor the previous result can be corrected or a completely new text can be transcribed.
